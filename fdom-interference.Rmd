Currently, only data from North Inlet-Winyah Bay:

```{r load-data, include = FALSE, results = FALSE}

source(here::here('R', '02.2_load_all_data.R'))
source(here::here('R', 'interference', '03_fdom-load-wrangle-run.R'))
```

```{r, fig.cap ="Average fluorescent dissolved organic matter (QSU) and chlorophyll fluorescence (RFU) from one trial"}
fdom_interf
```

General comments:

+   Didnâ€™t get up to max QSU seen in system (~120)
+   Compared to natural data, when QSU is high, RFU are not as high as they got in experiment
